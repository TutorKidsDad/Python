### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-codes.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the scripts or explore the notebooks.
Using Python on Linux is straightforward because Python is often pre-installed in most Linux distributions. Here's an introduction to get you started with Python on Linux:

### 1. **Check if Python is Installed**

Most modern Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is installed, open your terminal and type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

or

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, this command will display the version of Python installed (e.g., `Python 3.x.x`). If it's not installed, you can easily install it using the package manager of your distribution.

### 2. **Installing Python on Linux**

If Python is not installed, or you want to install a different version, you can use your package manager. Here are the commands for common Linux distributions:

- **Ubuntu/Debian-based**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3
  ```

- **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3
  ```

- **CentOS/RHEL**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install python3
  ```

Once installed, verify the installation again by running `python3 --version`.

### 3. **Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

For project isolation and to manage dependencies effectively, it's a good practice to use a virtual environment. This ensures that you can work on different projects with different dependency versions without conflicts.

- To create a virtual environment, you need the `venv` module (usually included with Python 3.x).
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv myenv
  ```

- To activate the virtual environment:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

  After activation, your prompt will change to show the virtual environment's name, indicating that you are working inside it.

- To deactivate the virtual environment:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

### 4. **Installing Python Packages**

To install additional Python packages, you can use `pip`, Python's package manager. For example, to install `numpy`:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

You can also install a list of packages from a `requirements.txt` file (often used in Python projects):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. **Running Python Scripts**

To run a Python script, navigate to the directory where your `.py` script is located and run:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Alternatively, you can run Python interactively by just typing:

```bash
python3
```

This opens the Python interpreter, where you can type and execute Python code line by line.

### 6. **Using Python's Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**

While you can write Python code using any text editor (e.g., Vim, Nano), you can also use Python-specific IDEs or text editors with Python support, such as:

- **VS Code** (requires installation):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install code
  ```
  
- **PyCharm** (IDE for Python development, available as free and paid versions)

- **Jupyter Notebooks** (especially for data science tasks):
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

You can then start a Jupyter Notebook with:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

### 7. **Python Documentation and Help**

Python has excellent documentation, which you can access online: [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/).

Additionally, you can use the built-in `help()` function in the Python shell for quick reference:
```python
help('modules')  # List available modules
help('os')       # Get help on the os module
```

### 8. **Common Linux Commands for Python Development**

- **Viewing Python file contents**:
  ```bash
  cat filename.py
  ```

- **Opening Python files in an editor**:
  ```bash
  nano filename.py  # or use your preferred text editor like vim or emacs
  ```

### Conclusion

Using Python on Linux is a seamless experience with powerful tools available for package management, environment isolation, and script execution. By following the steps above, you should be ready to start your Python development journey on Linux!
